First Paragraph - Recommender Introduction - Recommender should provide his details including his
designation, qualifications. Then he should write about the capacity in which has has associated with
you. Describe the project - RCMBrain]
In my observation, he has the capability to complete tasks assigned to him with minimum guidance,
making him intellectually independent. He was instrumental in adding value to the information
extraction pipeline for the Electronic health records. He attacks a difficult problem by breaking it into
smaller problems and then try building different solutions for them. He worked on following problems
with minimum guidance namely spelling correction, entity recognition using deep learning models like
LSTM, Stanford NLP. He also made sure that code is scalable is well documented for future
reference.
He shows ingenuity in his approach to tackle problems. In the spelling correction problem, one clever
solution he used was the soundex algorithm, in which he indexed the words using their phonetic
sound and then search for their neighbouring strings. Alongside, he also worked on a deep learning
based approach spelling corrector. Finally he clubbed the two approaches to build a robust spelling
corrector. He has a rare skill to focus both on the granular details and bigger picture of the product.
He demonstrates the required qualities of a team player and communicate lucidly and succinctly with
other team members. He was proactive in his approach and would do a literature review, writing code
considering different use cases and its code documentation. He is a strong proponent of data literacy
and organising various knowledge sessions events open to people with different backgrounds. He
quickly adapted to the cross-cultural work environment.
On a personal note, he is a well rounded individual, besides solving problems he has great interest in
music. He has also shown his adeptness at organizational skills, especially in a cross-cultural setting.
He is approachable and easy to communicate with.
I concur with his decision to pursue masters at J. MACK ROBINSON COLLEGE OF BUSINESS, GSU
and strongly recommend him for admission at your university along with Teaching
assistantship/Research assistantship with means of full financial aid.
